            <h2>Headers</h2>
            <p>A header takes a piece of text, and makes it stand out to the crowd! It can be used to start off a section, most commonly. Below are all the header types:</p>
            <h1>This is a "h1" header</h1>
            <h2>This is a "h2" header</h2>
            <h3>This is a "h3" header</h3>
            <h4>This is a "h4" header</h4>
            <h5>This is a "h5" header</h5>
            <h6>This is a "h6" header</h6>

            <h2>Paragraphs</h2>
            <p>A paragraph is something that creates a new paragraph. Each new paragraph made, is made below the last one, with some space above and below it.</p>
            <p>This is the second paragraph to this section, using <strong>&lt;p&gt;</strong>. Notice how it has a little bit of space from the paragraph above.</p>
