            <h2>Divisions</h2>
            <p>A division, or div, is something that seperates a section so 1 section can have multiple different looks</p>
            <p>A div is like a paragraph, except you can't add text to a div, but each new div will be below the last</p>
            <div id="example-div">
                <p>This is a paragraph inside a div</p>
            </div>
            <p>And this is a paragraph outside a div</p>
        </section>
        <section id="spans">
            <h2>Spans</h2>
            <p>A span is different to a div. A span can be nested inside a paragraph, so that the paragraph can have different looks to different words.</p>
            <p>When you create multiple spans, until there's a new paragraph created, each span will be side-by-side in a web browser</p>
            <p><span id="example-span-1">This is a span, </span><span id="example-span-2">and this is a span</span></p>
            <span id="example-span-3">This is a span outside a paragraph, </span><span id="example-span-4">and this span is next to it</span>
