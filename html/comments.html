            <h2>How to create comments</h2>
            <p>To create a comment in a piece of code, all you do is:</p>
            <p id="comment">&lt;!-- Do this --&gt;</p>
            <!-- This is a comment -->
        </section>
        <section id="why">
            <h2>Why they're useful</h2>
            <p>Comments are useful for fixing bugs in your code, if there's something specific that you've found isn't working.</p>
            <p>By creating a comment, you can see exactly where you need to fix and find it quickly!</p>
            <p>Without a comment in your code, you can spend hours searching for the bit of code you need, so it's best practice to put a comment on each new section in your code.</p>
            <p>Since coders work in teams, multiple people will be reading your code. Comments in your code will help the next person find where you left off, or if they see a bug, or there's something they need to change, your comment will help them find it quickly and easily</p>
